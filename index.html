						Say who you are - work on a local tourism website called Eastlife which has sister websites including a tourist guide for Chinese visitors to the UK.
						Been asked to speak to you about WordPress plugins

					<h2>What are plugins?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Might seem obvious but worth spending some time understanding what plugins are - and why they are additional and seperate from the WordPress core.
						You might ask "Why aren't plugins in WP core?". Let's look at what WP itself says.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/blackboard.jpg">
					<p>According to the WordPress Codex: <q cite="https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins">
						&ldquo;Plugins are ways to <span class="emphasize">extend</span> and <span class="emphasize">add</span> to the functionality that already exists in WordPress.
The core of WordPress is designed to be <span class="emphasize">lean and lightweight</span>, to maximize flexibility and minimize code bloat. Plugins then offer custom functions and features so that each user can <span class="emphasize">tailor</span> their site to their <span class="emphasize">specific</span> needs.&rdquo;</q>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						
					</aside>

				<section data-background="img/question.jpg">
					<h2>What plugins should I use?</h2>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/blackboard.jpg">
					<p>There is no such thing as an essential plugin. It will depend upon your site's needs and other factors such as the hosting platform you are on.</p>
					<p>If a plugin were 'essential' to the running of WordPress it would be already have been incorporated into the core of WordPress</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Every site is unique. Plugins allow you to customise a site for specific needs, but as each site has different needs the plugins each site uses will be different.
						Temptation might be to go home after this meeting and install a load of plugins that have been recommended. But you should always think about your site's need and consider if you really need a plugin.
						1. Hosting: If your host does auto backups you don't need a backup plugin. Similarly with caching plugins.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/blackboard.jpg">
					<h2>First things first - planning</h2>
					<p>Rather than asking what plugins you should use, ask yourself what functionality you need your site to have.</p>
					<p>For anything more than a hobbyist site you should plan out what you want to achieve. Think about what the essential objectives of your site are and plan to meet those.</p>
					<p>Beware of adding lots of bells and whistles to your site - you might end up distracting users from what you really want to achieve.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Give examples of social media feeds and new tickers distracting from a marketing site.
						Having a short avg visitor duration on your site might be because you've encouraged visitors to browse away.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/blackboard.jpg">
					<h2>Keep it simple</h2>
					<p>The idea of planning a site is to boil things down to the essentials and focus on your key objectives.</p>
					<p>This will help when selecting plugins, but will also help avoid the site growing out of control. The easier it is for a user to get the information the better. Ideally the user will be able to get the information from the front page without clicking on anything...</p>
					<p>...With this in mind think about simple ways to implement your objectives without using plugins. For example do you need a contact form on your site when a simple email address will do the job?</p>

					<h2>Plugins best practice</h2>
					<p>Develop your site locally. Spin up a test site, seperate from your main project and have fun experimenting with plugins there. Test them and make decisions there before installing on your main site.</p>
					<p>Research your plugins. Look at reviews, number of installs etc. But also look at the level of support - check out resources such as <a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/">wpmudev</a></p>
					<p>Backup your database and files before updating plugins - but keep plugins and WordPress core updated</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						1. This is good practice for many reasons. Will stop db being clogged up - get you to feel comfortable - allows free experimentation.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/blackboard.jpg">
					<h2>Plugins and themes</h2>
					<p>Themes do more than control the look of a site. They provide areas for posts and widgets to appear in and can affect the content of posts.</p>
					<p>Therefore be aware that some plugins will not work with some themes, and that some themes have been written with specific plugins in mind - so other plugins may not sit happily with them.</p>
					<p>If you are thinking of using a bespoke theme for your project you need to consider how it will affect plugin functionality. Again this comes down to planning.</p>

					<h2>Plugin pitfalls</h2>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/blackboard.jpg">
					<ul>
					<li>Plugins can conflict with each other</li>
					<li>Badly written plugins can slow your site down</li>
					<li>Lots of plugins can make the admin and new post areas a mess of options</li>
					<li>Plugins seldom do exactly what you want - you need to be adaptable</li>
					<li>As WordPress is upgraded older plugins can stop working</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						1. Explain why plugins should be disabled before using a new one
						3. Explain about clients using site and keeping it simple for them
						5. Why it's important to select plugins that are well supported
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/blackboard.jpg">
					<h2>Guidelines</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Try to keep plugins to a minimum</li>
						<li>Focus on your objectives, not bells and whistles</li>
						<li>Only use one plugin for a task if possible</li>
						<li>Deactivate and remove plugins you don't need</li>
						<li>Beware plugins that promise speed increases</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						5. Find out what your bottleneck is - perhaps a better host is needed?
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/blackboard.jpg">
					<h2>Guidelines pt 2</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Develop locally and test plugins thoroughly before deploying live</li>
						<li>Make sure you have a backup strategy and...</li>
						<li>...backup before activating or updating plugins</li>
						<li>Do your research before installing plugins</li>
					</ul>

						<p>Next</p>
						<p>Next up is some more advanced stuff Simon has asked me to speak on</p>
						<p>WordPress has developed an easy to use GUI to let people administrate their sites without any coding.</p>
						<p>However, sometimes as a developer you want the convience and speed of a command line</p>
						<p>This is where WP-CLI comes in</p>
